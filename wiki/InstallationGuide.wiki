= Introduction =

OAuzz has been developed in Python to be cross-platform; so no real installation is required.

Nevertheless, OAuzz requires external librearies to work. These libraries have to be installed previously.


= Details =

The main libraries which are used by OAuzz are:

  * [https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/ PyCrypto - https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/]
  * urllib and urllib2
  * sqlite3
  * BaseHTTPServer, urlparse, getpass, random, math, sys and time

From the above list, the only librarie has to be installed is PyCrypto. The rest of them are part of the basic Python installation.


===PyCrypto===

   # Download PyCrypto from [https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/]
   # Install it (Linux example):
{{{ 
# Untar it (x.y must be replaced for the downloaded version)
$ tar zxvf pycrypto-x.y.tar.gz

# Configure it
$ cd pycrypto-x.y/
$ ./configure

# Build it
$ python setup.py build

# Install it
$ sudo python setup.py install
}}}
